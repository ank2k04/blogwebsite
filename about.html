        <p>
          <strong>Hello, my name is Ankush,</strong>. I had so many things that
          I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
          any lf it because there was too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things were terrible. I had a collage that I hated, a home that I
          didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          BTW.. I'm an anime enthusiast with a particular passion for romantic
          comedies. Although I'm just an average person, I have a deep love for
          travel and exploring new places, especially when I have the
          opportunity to share those experiences with others. As an introvert, I
          sometimes struggle to connect with new people, but I'm always up for
          an adventure if it means getting to know someone better.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one secret I'd like to share: I have feelings for my best
          friend. Despite the challenges that come with these feelings, I am
          committed to being honest with myself and those around me, and I'm
          looking forward to seeing where life takes me next. Thank you for
          taking the time to learn a bit about me.
        </p>
